    <h1 class="title is-1">Brave New Tomorrows</h1>
    <p>Can you imagine different tomorrows?</p>
    <p>What would it be like to live in that world?</p>
    <p>
      How do you think technologies being developed today will affect our
      tomorrow?
    </p><br>

    <p>
      This meetup aims to build a creative and collaborative space to combine
      world-building techniques with design fiction to discover unseen potential
      futures. Join us to speculatively build prototypes of possible tomorrows,
      represent worlds and understand the implications of our potential futures.
      Our aim is to learn from each other and have fun while reflecting on
      problems related to topics such as the future of technology, artificial
      intelligence, climate change, sustainability and social justice, so as to
      imagine together the future we want (or don’t). The ‘how’ is open, through
      writing, art, short films, prototypes, mementos of experiences and
      anything that inspires us and the people around us.

    <h2 class="title is-2">What to expect?</h2>
    <p>
      We are just starting! This project is very much an evolving one and we
      expect things to change as more people get involved. If you are interested
      and want to brainstorm more ideas, please get in touch.
    </p>

    <p>We would like the project to include the following:</p>

    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Topics Generation Sessions: let’s gather and brainstorm topics of
          interest
        </li>
        <li>
          Design Fiction Sessions: we all imagine possible futures for a specific
          topic we’ve picked for the day
        </li>
        <li>
          Creative Sessions: time to create with the stories we came up with -
          writing, painting, drawing.. anything you fancy!
        </li>
        <li>
          Educational Sessions: we’ll invite experts in the field to share their
          experience on some of our topics
        </li>
      </ul>
