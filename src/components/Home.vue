    It's 2021 on Planet Earth.
The world has gone through a complete and unimaginable metamorphosis.
Transferred to a cold screen it became remote and distant.
Time felt like an unreachable illusion.
The fast pulse of Earth slowed down. (...)
After months in isolation, civilization begins to emerge again.
But human imagination has not been idle.
Humans now dare to dream and imagine together.
They dream of new tomorrows.
They design brave new tomorrows.

    <p>Can you imagine different tomorrows?<br>
    What would it be like to live in that world?<br>
      How do you think technologies being developed today will affect our
      tomorrow?

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.meetup.com/brave-new-tomorrows-creative-meetup/">Brave New Tomorrows meetup</a> (based in London) aims to build a creative and collaborative space to combine
      world-building techniques with design fiction to discover unseen potential
      futures. Join us to speculatively build prototypes of possible tomorrows,
      represent worlds and understand the implications of our potential futures.
      Our aim is to learn from each other and have fun while reflecting on
      problems related to topics such as the future of technology, artificial
      intelligence, climate change, sustainability and social justice, so as to
      imagine together the future we want (or don’t). The ‘how’ is open, through
      writing, art, short films, prototypes, mementos of experiences and
      anything that inspires us and the people around us.
    </p> <br>
    <p>In case you are wondering, the name of the meetup is based on the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World">"Brave new world"</a> by Aldous Huxley.
